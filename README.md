### FB Automate Messages Remove (for lazy person)

FB Automate Messages Remove (for lazy person), if you are not lazy enough just do the manual delete by visiting one-by-one your friends message. I create this because I don't want to see my past message with my friends so I don't have to memorize the memories and ease my move on.  

This program only deleted 10 messages per-run, so you have to run it repeatedly to delete all messages you have.  

##### How to Install (Python)

    1. git clone  
    2. python3 -m venv fbvenv  
    3. source fbvenv/bin/activate  
    4. pip install selenium  

##### Run Program
    
    python del_message.py --email <your_fb_email_account> --pwd <your_fb_password_account>
